    <p class="lead">The Seattle Conlang Club Sign Language Linguistics Project aims to compile information and resources for the study of sign language linguistics that is not focused on any specific sign language.</p>
    <p>This project is aimed primarily towards people interested in creating sign language conlangs, but may also be useful for anyone interested in comparative sign language linguistics in general. It aims to provide readers with accurate information backed by academic sources wherever possible. If you spot any errors or have suggestions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:fredchan@conlang.club">fredchan@conlang.club</a>.</p>
