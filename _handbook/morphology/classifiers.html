  <p class="lead">Classifiers are morphemes that are used to represent movement, location, and shape of a noun referent. Classifiers are thought to be universal to sign languages.</p>

    <h3>Types</h3>

    <p>There are multiple different ways to categorize classifiers in sign languages based on how the represent its referent. One such set of categories is Supalla (1982)'s set, originally devised for ASL:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Semantic/entity classifiers: Represents the semantic category of the referent</li>
      <li>Size and shape specifiers (SASS): Represents the physical characteristics of a referent using handshape</li>
      <li>Handling classifiers: Represents how a referent would be held or handled</li>
      <li>Body part specifiers: Represents human or body part referents, such as limbs</li>
    </ul>
