    <p class="lead">Location refers to the part of the body where a sign is articulated.</p>

    <p>94.25% of documentation on 87 sign languages in the Sign Language Analyses (SLAY) database identify handshape as a distinctive parameter. <cite>(Tatman 2015)</cite></p>

    <h3>Neutral space</h3>

    <p class="lead">The most common location for signs is neutral space, the area in front of the signer's torso.</p>

    <p>Neutral space is a rather large region, but the precise zone within neutral space that a sign is produced in does not change its meaning. Different parts of neutral space may however be used to index referents, similar to pronouns.</p>

    <h3>Location inventories and distribution <cite>(Rozelle 2003)</cite></h3>

    <p class="lead">Sign languages each have different location inventories, though even unrelated languages may share many locations in common. Languages with larger location inventories have larger handshape inventories as well.</p>
