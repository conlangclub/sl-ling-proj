      Lexical signs are composed of at least three constituents:
      <ul>
        <li>Handshape - Configuration of the hand and fingers</li>
        <li>Location - Hand location relative to the body</li>
        <li>Movement - Hand movement between locations or hand-internal movement</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Some analyses also include the following constituents, which are sometimes called <i>minor parameters</i>:
      <ul>
        <li>Palm Orientation - Orientation of the palms</li>
        <li>Nonmanual parameters (NMP) - Parameters that don't involve the hands, including facial expression</li>
        <li>Contact - Regions of the hand that contact each other or other body parts</li>
        <li>Number of hands - Number of hands used in a sign</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Across documentation on 87 sign languages surveyed in the Sign Language Analyses (SLAY) database, all of them include handshape as a distinctive parameter, 98.6% include movement, and 94.25% include location. Conversely, the minor parameters <i>palm orientation, number of hands, and NMPs</i> are present in 52% or fewer of these language's documentations. <cite>(Tatman 2015)</cite></p>

    <p class="lead">Each sign language has a different inventory of available values for each parameter. For example, some handshapes used in ASL are not used in Korean Sign Language and vice versa.</p>
    
    <p>
      What should be considered a phoneme (or segment) in sign languages is cause for some debate. In some analyses, each of these constituents could be considered a phoneme that is articulated simultaneously with the other segments in the sign, while in other analyses the entire sign is a single phoneme and each constituent is a feature analogous to the features in spoken language phonemes (e.g. voiced, obstruent, nasal).
