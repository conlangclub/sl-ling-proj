  <p class="lead">Non-manuals, sometimes called Non-manual markers (NMMs) or Non-manual parameters (NMPs), are constituents like head tilt, body tilt, and facial expression that don't involve the hand in its articulation.</p>

  <p>35.23% of documentation on 87 sign languages in the Sign Language Analyses (SLAY) database identify non-manuals as a distinctive parameter. <cite>(Tatman 2015)</cite></p>

    <h3>Uses</h3>

    <p class="lead">Non-manuals have a diverse range of uses, even in a single sign language, marking lexical, syntactic, or prosodic information.</p>

    <p>Even when non-manual parameters are available in a sign language, not every lexical sign specifies a non-manual. That is, there will be lexical signs that do not change their even if non-manual parameters change when saying them. <cite>(Susanne 2014)</cite> This means that lexical signs can be articulated simultaneously with morphemes that are articulated non-manually, a feature common to most sign languages.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold">Eye gaze</h4>
      <p>
        Eye gaze has been observed to fill several roles. For example, eye gaze in BSL has at least five different uses for eye gaze, including: <cite>(Sutton-Spence & Woll 1999)</cite>
        <ul>
          <li>Lexical distinctions (e.g. <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> <a href="https://www.signdictionary.co.uk/view/boss?q=boss" class="small-caps">GOD</a> vs <a href="https://www.signdictionary.co.uk/view/God?q=god" class="small-caps">BOSS</a>, where <span class="small-caps">GOD</span> is articulated with upwards eye gaze)</li>
          <li>Use in conjunction with location and movements of referents in space</li>
          <li>Showing role shift</li>
          <li>Contrasting rhetorical and echo questions with genuine questions</li>
          <li>Marking time</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <section>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Facial expression</h4>
      <p>
        Prillwitz 1985 identifies the following constituents of facial expression used in sign languages:
        <ul>
          <li>Position of the head, shoulders and torso (e.g. leaning, inclined, tense)</li>
          <li>Eyebrows (e.g. raised, furrowed)</li>
          <li>Eye aperture (e.g. wide open, squint, blinking)</li>
          <li>Direction of eye gaze (e.g. straight ahead, aside, up/downwards)</li>
          <li>Mouth (e.g. open, closed, pressed together, corners up/down, puckered, tongue)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>In all known sign languages, certain facial expression on its own can have adverbial or adjectival meanings. For example, in <abbr title="German Sign Language">DGS</abbr> sucking in the cheeks marks <a href="Diminutive">diminutive</a> while puffing out the cheeks marks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative">augmentative</a>.</p>

      <p>Facial expression has been observed to be an essential part of a lexical sign's phonological description for certain signs, and is often obligatory in emotion signs like <span class="small-caps">HAPPY</span> and <span class="small-caps">SAD</span>, even if other signs in the language are not be specified for facial expression. Facial expression can even define a minimal pair, such as in <abbr title="Catalan Sign Language">LSC</abbr> where <span class="small-caps">PITY</span> and <span class="small-caps">FALL-IN-LOVE</span> are distinguished by a negative and positive facial expression respectively. <cite>(Pfau & Quer 2010)</cite></p>

      <p>A facial expression associated with the meaning expressed by a sign (e.g. a expression in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> <a href="https://www.signbsl.com/sign/sad" class="small-caps">SAD</a>), has been observed to spread over the rest of the sentence, such as in <span class="small-caps">SAD ME WHY RABBIT DIE</span>. The sad expression is only interrupted by the sign <span class="small-caps">WHY</span>, which has its own obligatory facial expression. <cite>(Sutton-Spence & Woll 1999)</cite></p>
