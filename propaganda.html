      <a href="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-en.png"><img class="border" src="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-en.png" alt="The same poster written in English." width="300"></a>

      <figcaption>A version of the poster written in a conlang would always be put side-by-side with an English version of the poster. The overall design of each would be the same except for the background color, so the viewer understands they are the same poster in different languages.</figcaption>
